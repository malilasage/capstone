# About the Project
Hunt is a job search dashboard that allows users to keep track of jobs they are currently in the process of applying for. Inspiration for this project comes from bullet journaling, which is an analog customizable organization system. More can be learned about bullet journaling [here](http://bulletjournal.com/). In keeping with the bullet journal philosophy, Hunt aims to be customizable to a users individual needs.

## Dashboard

The first thing displayed on the dashboard is a visualization of the users current goal, which is implemented with [charts.js](http://www.chartjs.org/). Under that, a list of all the users jobs is displayed. Alongside each job are associated tasks, with icons that track user progress.

## Individual Jobs

Clicking on a job title will bring up an individual view of that job. In addition to the information displayed on the dashboard, this also shows the location of the job, it's description, and a featured review of that company from [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/developer/index.htm)

## Search

Hunt also has built-in search functionality, provided by the [Indeed API](https://www.indeed.com/publisher).

## Custom Settings

This is where users can set goals and add custom columns. The goal setting is very modular, allowing the user to tailor objectives to their own desires. Custom columns can be added to suit personal needs, helping users account for things specific to them that they may encounter in their job search.
