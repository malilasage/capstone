## <a name="code"></a> Getting Started
This project is built using the MEAN stack. To learn more about setting up a project using this stack, follow this tutorial on [scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/setting-up-a-mean-stack-single-page-application).

### Prerequisites
Must have MongoDB set up and be running Mongo locally.

### Installing
Install npm packages
`npm install`

There are two options to start the server. You can either run it with nodemon or browser-sync. Personally, I have found browser-sync to be a little slow.
```
//nodemon
npm install --save nodemon
nodemon server/server.js

//browser-sync
npm start
```
